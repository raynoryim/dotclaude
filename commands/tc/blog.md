# /tc:blog - Analyze codebase and generate technical blog posts about interesting aspects

## Purpose

Deeply analyze the current codebase to identify interesting technical angles, provide options for the user to choose from, and generate comprehensive technical blog posts (5000+ words) with mermaid diagrams about the selected topic.

## Usage

```
/tc:blog [language]
```

## Arguments

- `language` - Blog post language (default: Chinese). Supported: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German

## Execution

Use @tech-philosophy-writer as the primary blog writer, output the blog post in ./blog/ directory.

### Analysis Process

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis**

1. **Initial Codebase Survey**
   - Scan project structure and identify main components
   - Analyze programming languages, frameworks, and technologies used
   - Understand the project's domain and business purpose
   - Identify key architectural patterns and design decisions

2. **Deep Technical Analysis**
   - **Architecture & Design Patterns**: Identify unique architectural decisions, design patterns implementation, microservices design, etc.
   - **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Find interesting algorithms, optimization techniques, custom data structures
   - **Product & Business Logic**: Discover clever product features, business rule implementations, user experience considerations
   - **Performance & Scalability**: Analyze performance optimizations, caching strategies, scalability solutions
   - **Security & Reliability**: Examine security implementations, error handling, resilience patterns
   - **Developer Experience**: Study build systems, testing strategies, development workflows
   - **Innovation & Technology**: Identify cutting-edge technology usage, novel solutions to common problems

3. **Interest Discovery**
   - Look for non-obvious technical solutions
   - Identify creative problem-solving approaches
   - Find examples of excellent engineering practices
   - Discover trade-offs and engineering decisions
   - Locate performance bottlenecks and their solutions
   - Examine error handling and edge case management

**Phase 2: Topic Selection**

Present 5-8 interesting angles to the user with descriptions:
